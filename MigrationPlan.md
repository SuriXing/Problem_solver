## 🔄 Migration Progress Tracking

As we complete each task, we'll mark it with a ✅ to track our progress. Tasks in progress are marked with 🟡.

## 📝 Notes

- The existing codebase uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML
- The new project is using React with TypeScript
- We'll need to transform imperative DOM manipulations to React's declarative approach
- Font Awesome is already installed in the new project, make sure to use the React components
- Visual comparison tools are available in the `visual-comparison` directory to help with Phase 7
- Theme constants have been defined in `worry-solver-theme-constants.ts` to ensure visual consistency
- A tracker for visual consistency implementation is available in `visual-consistency-tracker.md`

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin the migration, we'll start with Phase 1 and proceed systematically through each phase, marking tasks as completed along the way.
