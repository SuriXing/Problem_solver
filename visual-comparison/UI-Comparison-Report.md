# Visual Comparison Report: Problem_solver vs. worry-solver

## Overview
This document tracks the visual comparison between the original Problem_solver project and the new React-based worry-solver implementation. The goal is to ensure visual consistency and user experience parity between the two versions.

## Methodology
1. Each page is compared side-by-side using identical viewport dimensions
2. Screenshots are taken of both versions and key differences are documented
3. Specific CSS properties are compared using browser developer tools
4. Interactive elements are tested to ensure identical behavior
